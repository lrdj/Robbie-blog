<p>Well no painting done at all since my last blog; Tummy bug knocked me out for a few days and spent a bit of time preparing for my job interview at Oxford Brookes University tomorrow. In fact I am typing this on a horrible PC at the easyinternet cafe on Tottenham Court Road, while I kill some time before I go and stay with Billy in Finsbury Parkthis evening. I came up to London early, so as I could visit <a href="http://www.tate.org.uk/britain/">Tate Britain</a> to see the Gwen and Augustus John and The Turner Prize exhibitions. Well I went throught Turner Prize in extra quick time (even for me). There is no point in me pretending that this stuff is interesting to me; the Turner prize has become a curator&#8217;s infliction and now going through the spaces I am reminded of academic and scholarly research, dispassionate and without any soul. I remember a few years ago when I worked at Gray&#8217;s School of Art in Aberdeen, the head of research was very pleased with me as I was toying with abandoning painting to work on an animated project on the computer. She kept telling me that it was &#8216;so much more exciting than making yet more paintings, anyone can make paintings&#8230;&#8217;. This comment has eaten away inside me for years, and yes, for a while I dabbled with the possibilities of digital work, but it came nowhere near the raw experience of exposing one&#8217;s vision through marks with pencils and paint. I am now wholly commited to paint in my own particular way and shuffling through the Turner Prize as I have just done only confirms this to me.</p>

<p>I was delighted to visit the comprehensive show of Gwen and Augustus John&#8217;s work. However, it really did highlight just how much more sophisticated and charged Gwen&#8217;s work is in comparison to her more showy brother. Her brooding portraits resonating through understated tone and dabbled paint. And her drawing is exquisit&#8230;. a real tonic to see. Oh, and they even has on display the Gwen John which I have seen for years at Aberdeen Art Gallery. Like bumping into an old friend.</p>

<p>There was also a nice showcase of Paula Rego&#8217;s work on and an exhibition of drawing selected from the Tate&#8217;s collection.</p>

<p>I love the Tate Britain (The Old Tate Gallery). Its salons are so well proportioned and you can just drift into a room full of William Blakes or Stanley Spencers on your way out (as I did today). Wonderful.</p>

<p>Well off to Oxford tomorrow for the interview. Wish me luck as I think this does soundlike the job for me at the moment.</p>
