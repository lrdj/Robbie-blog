<p>I spent a highly enjoyable weekend at Billy and Ohna's house in London (as part of my homeless weekend series).</p>

<p>On Saturday, I made a beeline for the Tate Modern to see the Frida Kahlo exhibition at last. It was truly wonderful to see just about all her paintings in one place and despite the show being ludicrously busy, I got so much out of it. For me, her work resonates way beyond the limited contrainsts of 'art' and is a true dialogue  of her life, times, politics and social history.</p>

<p>On Sunday, we all popped down to the Notting Hill Carnival. The Bank holiday weather gods were on our side and it was a glorious day in the thrawl of jamican beats. So, thank you Billy and Ohna, Kiloh and Apoa for having me along!!</p>
