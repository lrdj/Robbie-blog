<p>Well another change. Today is the last day in my current house in Oxford, so thank you Rachel and Michael for being great housemate. Today is also the opening of the show at Sarah WIseman Gallery. And Tomorrow I am off to Cyprus until the 28th July. Keep looking here for news of the trip. Nothing else to say as it is 6am in the morning and am annoyed I woke so early.</p>
