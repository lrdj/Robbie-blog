<p>I quite enjoyed my last week; by day I was this mild mannered lecturer - by night I was this demon framer working to a tight deadline. But got them all done and sent off. I even went to see <em>Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire</em> as a wee treat last night. (bloody good!) Anyway, much too tired to give you chapter and verse so here are some picures of the works framed:</p>
