<p>Well today is my last day living in Hastings before I start my new job in Oxford on Wednesday. Although I will be coming back for weekends until I can find a place to stay in Oxford. <span class="caps">SO, </span>today I packed up my studio with too many works unfinished, alas. I am afraid that my Christmas burst of art activity did not emerge as I did what most of us do at this time of year; eat, drink, sleep and be merry.</p>

<p>The challenge for me now is to get the best of my 2004 work exhibited in group shows up and down the Uk, while I continue to make new work and lecture in Oxford. A challenge, but one I now think I am ready for. </p>

<p>My first duties as a lecturer is to take the foundation students to Berlin from next saturday for a week. So, this is a great opportunity to get to know the students and staff, while looking at art and culture. I am really looking forward to it.</p>

<p>So no new work to be posted on this site. I was hoping to put up a <em>Best of 2004</em> page, but time has just run out really. I want to thank all those Hastings who made my time here fantastic. If it does not work out for me in Oxford, then I would gladly come back to Hastings as it is in many ways the perfect place to be an artist with little money.</p>

<p>A happy new year to all my blog readers (I know who you are!!) and I think it will be interesting to see how the site and the blog develop over 2005 with less time to devote to it.</p>
