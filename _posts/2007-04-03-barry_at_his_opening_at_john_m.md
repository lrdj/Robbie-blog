<p>I am not even at <a href="http://www.barrymcglashan.co.uk/">Barry</a>'s opening tonight at <a href="http://www.jmlondon.com/">John Martin</a>, but by the powers of technology (Catharine is there), I have the first picture while the opening is still going. </p>

<p><a href="http://mtengine.pumpernickle.net/mt_pages/robbiebushe/Barry%20at%20jm1.html" onclick="window.open('http://mtengine.pumpernickle.net/mt_pages/robbiebushe/Barry%20at%20jm1.html','popup','width=600,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img src="http://mtengine.pumpernickle.net/mt_pages/robbiebushe/Barry%20at%20jm1-thumb.jpg" width="130" height="104" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>Looks like he is having a good time. Well back to my gouaches for me...</p>
