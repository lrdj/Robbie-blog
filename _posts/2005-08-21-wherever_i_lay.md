<p>Just a quickie. Spent a lovely week staying at Claire and Richard's family home in Oxford while I looked for a new place to stay. They were so kind and made me feel extremely welcome as well as feeding me wonderful food. Went to see <a href="http://chocolatefactorymovie.warnerbros.com/">Charlie and the Chocolate Factory</a> with Claire and her son, Alex and friend Frankie. I loved it! Especially the first half of the movie.</p>

<p>I found a new place to stay in Oxford, but wont be able to move in until the 5th September, so I am going to stay in student halls until then and visit friends at weekends. I went down to Hastings this weekend to visit my sister's family. I haven't been to Hastings since March, and it has been a lovely weekend by the sea catching up with some of those I met here when I lived here last year. It was the end of the <a href="http://www.visithastings.com/events_oldtownweek/default.asp">Hastings Old Town Festival</a> and we managed to catch the cavelcade on Saturday afternoon. There are so many truly extraordinary events throughout the year in Hastings.</p>

<p>Back to Oxford tomorrow and back to work at Brookes in earnest..</p>
