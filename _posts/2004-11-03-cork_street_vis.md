<p>Well I am still in London today as I am working in Rochester tomorrow and friday and it seem silly to go back to Hastings for one day.</p>

<p>So,took the opportunity to have a look around <a href="http://www.artefact.co.uk/g-crk.htm">Cork Street</a>. And what agood time to go as there were severalshows which interested me which is unusual.</p>

<p>First off there was my old art tutor from <a href="http://www.eca.ac.uk">Edinburgh College of Art</a>, John Houston at <a href="http://www.browseanddarby.co.uk/content/bd_set.asp">Browse and Darby</a>.</p>

<p>John was in his last year before retiring when he taught me in my degree year in 1989. He was such a gentle man who commanded respect, simply by being so down to earth. It is great to see him still making such vibrant and  youthful work.</p>

<p>Next up was was Mary Fedden at the <a href="http://www.redfern-gallery.com/pages/thumbnaillist/303.html">Redfern Gallery</a>. No images on their site as yet, but yet another stalwart quirky painter who has a strong pictorial vision.</p>

<p>Then it was on to Richard Whatcock at the <a href="http://www.adamgallery.clara.net/Whadcock/whadcockth.htm">Adam Gallery</a>. This is the first I had seen of this artist&#8217;s work, but I was bowled over by the luscious atmospheric landscapes, which reminded me of my early train journeys beofre dawn, to Rochester.</p>

<p>Oh, and while I was at the Adam Gallery, I noticed a cataloue by another artist they show called <a href="http://www.adamgallery.clara.net/richard/rccalling/rcth.htm">Richard Cartwright</a>. Now, this work I would like to see more of. Fairytale colour mixed with brief glimses of landscape and figues which resonate emotion. Was tempeted to buy the book but I must watch my money at the moment.</p>

<p>Finally,I saw another great show at <a href="http://www.houldsworth.co.uk/current/index.html">Houldsworth</a>. The artist name is Gordon Cheung and his work comprises of huge colaged and painted images which are both painterly and contemporary in feel. It was quite a wee find to see so much I liked along one street. I didn&#8217;twant to see anything else in fear of gallery burn out.</p>
