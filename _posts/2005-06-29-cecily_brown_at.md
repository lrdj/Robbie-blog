<p><em>'Almost every time a painting show happens, or a young painter makes a splash - in the market as much as on a canvas - someone crows about a return to painting. As if, in a moment of blinding revelation, the entire art world had come to its senses: what fools we've been! Painting! Now we don't have to worry about all that impenetrable contemporary art rubbish! Sanity regained.'</em></p>

<p>Adrian Searle, Art Critic, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/">The Guardian</a>, Tuesday June 28, 2005. ( see full review <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/arts/features/story/0,11710,1516252,00.html">here</a>)</p>

<p>I went the the private view of Cecily Brown last night at <a href="http://www.modernartoxford.org.uk/">Modern Art Oxford</a>. And I for one thoroughly enjoyed it. Despite Adrian Searle's (a wonderful art critic) take that we should be careful not to get over-excited everytime a genuine painter gets a contemporary art billing in a major museum, I was just so relieved to see someone who was exploring the stuff of paint in a sophisticated yet uncomplicated way. There are no post modern gimmicks, no wry asides within the images. They are luxuriously painted, and, I would expect, would have been dismissed had they been painted by a man for being exploitative and misogynistic due to to their highly sexual subject matter. But that is the stuff for a bigger debate than my feeble brain can cope with at this hour in the morning.</p>

<p>The opening itself was good, and I bumbed into and old aquaintance and artist from Aberdeen, Andy Stenhouse, who is now living and working in Oxford. It was nice to talk in a familiar venacular about things which matter and dont matter! Tracy Emin was there! I should have had the brass neck to go and speak to her (well she is a single girl), but I did not. I actually loved her recent show at the <a href="http://www.whitecube.com/flash.html">white cube</a> in London and have been fascinated by her weekly column in the <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/">Independent</a> (alas not published online). So it would have been nice just have said hello...</p>

<p>2 days until cyprus...</p>
