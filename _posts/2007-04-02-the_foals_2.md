<p>It is good to see that the long tradition of art students becoming great bands is alive and well. Three students I had the pleasure to teach at Oxford Brookes are now part of tomorrow's next big thing - <a href="http://www.myspace.com/foals">The Foals</a>. Walter Gervers plays bass, Jack Beven on Drums and Tinhead does the graphic design (I am not familiar with the other three). The Foals are a five piece jittery punk/funk dance outfit with a destinctive sound. There are more influences from music I was listening to as a teenager than anything that is out now; <a href="http://www.leonardslair.co.uk/josefk.htm">Josek K</a>, <a href="http://www.dominorecordco.com/site/index.php?page=artists&amp;artistID=211">Fire Engines</a>, <a href="http://listen.to/orangejuice">Orange Juice</a>, <a href="http://www.clubdevo.com/">Devo</a>, <a href="http://www.gangoffour.co.uk/">Gang of Four</a> and <a href="http://www.apbtheband.com"><span class="caps">APB</span></a> (from Aberdeen recently reformed). Have a listen and look at their song/video for Hummer. Wonderful stuff.</p>
