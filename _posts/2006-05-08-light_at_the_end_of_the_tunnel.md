<p>Not a huge amount to say really. I have been working on the three pictures above this last week. I finally braved doing the big one of the pidgeon man/lady. I decided that it needed to be a lot cleaner and have no other figures, which were distracting and pointless. I think it looks more arresting now. Still much work to be done on it. The other two are nearly there. The lovers at the botanics is still a bit messy, but I see how to pull it all together now. one more session on both and they can be put to bed, hopefully.</p>

<p>That leaves the three others to work on and perhaps I wil have time to work up some of the little ones I started before xmas and never resolved.. Sometimes that works for me - rescueing old unfinished forgotten pictures. </p>

<p>Oh! I nearly forgot. I have been invited back out to Cyprus at the end of June for a month to teach and paint. So, it will be get the show ready, finish at Brookes and then off for a hot month in Limassol once again. Great!</p>
