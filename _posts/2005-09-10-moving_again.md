<p>This week i moved out of student halls and into my new room in a houseshare with Rachel and Michael. Rachel is the rowing correspondent for the the Daily Telegraph and has been very welcoming to me as I settle in. I have done a fair bit of socialising of late and it is now lovely to get to know a few more people in Oxford. Right now I am in the middle of moving my stuff which was in my studio up to my new home in a white van. I think I will always be hiring white vans for as long as I live.</p>
