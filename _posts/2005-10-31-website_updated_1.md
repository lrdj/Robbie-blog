<p>I am sure you will have noticed that I have updated my site to include the most recent work. I was too tired today to do anything except mess about on the computer... One of the reasons I do this blog and update my site regularly is so that people come back and see what has changed. So many websites , and particularly art websites, seem to stay the same for years, which is very annoying. I reackon I get more 'traffic' due to people coming back every now and again. It is always good for the ego...</p>
