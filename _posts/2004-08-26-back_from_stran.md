<p>Well, now I am back from my week long trip to visit my mum in Stranraer  with my sister, Claire and her children, Harper and Mae. We had a fine trip despite the weather being a lot colder and wetter. I wasn't planning to do a lot of drawing, but I ended up doing some at the <a href="http://www.rbge.org.uk/rbge/web/visiting/lbg.jsp#Location">Logan Botanic Garden</a> which was a lovely place.</p>

<p>I don't, however, think I am going to to suddenly produce a whole series of botanic garden pictures. Not just yet anyway. </p>

<p>While it was great to get away, I am gagging at the bit to get on with my painting. <a href="http://www.jmlondon.com/">John Martin of London</a> have asked me for work for the <a href="http://www.aafnyc.com/"><span class="caps">AAF</span> Contemporary Art Fair</a> in New York (formerly the New York Affordable Art Fair). So, I am now busy getting pictures framed etc.</p>

<p>On top of this, I have a job interview for a Painting Fellow at <a href="http://www.lancs.ac.uk/">Lancaster University</a> on the 3rd of September. But, actually, it is nice to be busy in this way; to do with my art, rather than busy with beurocracy. </p>

<p>So yesterday I found a great framer in George Street in the Old Town of Hastings who can do it in time and is very reasonable. So now, I can at last get back to my painting down the studio..</p>
