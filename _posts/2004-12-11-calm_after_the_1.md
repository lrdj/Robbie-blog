<p>Just a quickie to say that after all the excitement of last week, I have just be down the studio, trying to complete my garden painting and I think it now only has a couple of days to go - but you never know with painting - everything can still go wrong. here it is as of today:</p>

<table><tr><td><img alt="garden08sm.jpg" src="http://mtengine.pumpernickle.net/mt_pages/robbiebushe/previously/garden08sm.jpg" width="116" height="140" /></td></tr><tr><td><a href="http://mtengine.pumpernickle.net/mt_pages/robbiebushe/previously/garden08.html" onclick="window.open('http://mtengine.pumpernickle.net/mt_pages/robbiebushe/previously/garden08.html','popup','width=497,height=600,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false">View image</a></td></tr></table>

<p>I have also started a few small oils (or palette cleaners as I sometimes call them) as it is too hard to concentrate on the big painting all day. None of them are finished, but here is a photo of them so far:</p>

<table><tr><td><img alt="progress.jpg" src="http://mtengine.pumpernickle.net/mt_pages/robbiebushe/previously/progress.jpg" width="370" height="144" /></td></tr><tr><td><a href="http://mtengine.pumpernickle.net/mt_pages/robbiebushe/previously/progressbg.html" onclick="window.open('http://mtengine.pumpernickle.net/mt_pages/robbiebushe/previously/progressbg.html','popup','width=600,height=234,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false">View image</a></td></tr></table>

<p>Ialso got some nice news from my brother Chris in Edinburgh, who told me that I had sold a couple of the pictures I sent up to the <a href="http://www.scottish-gallery.co.uk">Scottish Gallery</a>, Xmas show. Which is alway great! </p>

<p>Anyway - off to the pub tonight for a birthday drink with my Hastings chums and tomorrow I am off to Chichester to see Suzie and Erin and then on to Oxford on Tuesday to sort out what I am doing in my new Job. Phew - it is all go, and Christmas still to come....</p>
