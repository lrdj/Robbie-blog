<p>Easter holidays at last. The last few weeks at Brookes have been difficult and seemingly endless. We had a huge number of students to interview for next year and it was the grueling period where our students get their portfolios ready for interview for degree courses. It got to the point where I was physically ill and incoherent while I was at work and immediately much better when not.. This is the problem with trying to fit a nearly full time job with the need to paint. And now I have the added but welcome distraction of going to Reading to visit Catharine. It is fantastic she is a painter herself and values the time we have to spend alone in the studio. So I have now managed to get a bit more work done in the last few weeks despite everything that has been going on. I am now back in my routine of 7am swim, 9am - 5pm work and 6pm - 10pm paint.. and weekends in Reading and day off monday in the studio. Glamorous lifestyle huh?</p>

<p>Yesterday was the first full day of my very short easter break and I had a welcome day off from everything. Catharine and I drove out to Wiltshire to see six of the famous white horses carved into the chalk hills. I had only really been aware of these due to the wonderful Eric Ravilious paintingâ€¨'TRAIN <span class="caps">LANDSCAPE'. </span></p>

<p>I had not realised that most of them dated from the the Victorian times; I had presumed they were far more historic and heathen than that. They were fantastic nonetheless and a great way to explore the countryside on a bright spring day. Maybe they might appear in my work at some point..</p>

<p>So on to the new work; well i am working to the theme 'there is something about Oxford..'  for the <a href="http://www.wisegal.com/menus/main.asp">Sarah Wiseman Gallery</a>. This has allowed me to explore further some of my demons about how I am coping with life here. I am simply using backdrops from some the common places I inhabit in Oxford and placing figures and fantasy characters to see what crops up. Once again, giant men are appearing and i think this is about feeling clumsy and unrefined in such a ethereal place. I like the giant scotsman in Christchurch playing fields placed as a visitor attraction. I think he may crop up again. I am posting pictures of these in a very unresolved state as they are on this late saturday night and am feeling very unsure about how they will turn out. Well I now have a few consecutive days to build up momentum so perhaps I will get some finished this week. </p>

<p>Interestingly, on the train back from Reading this morning, there were a number of morris dancers obviously off to a pagan festival. It was a busy train and I heard the sounds of shoe bells before I looked up to find a small group of feathered and hatted pagan types looking for free seats. Quite bizarre and it reminded me of the work I did in Hastings about the pagan festivals. I think I am going down to Hastings for the the May Day festivities and it will be nice to see it all again.</p>
