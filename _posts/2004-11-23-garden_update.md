<p>I have been concentrating on trying to complete my big garden painting, and there are two recent pictures of my progress so far above. I am beginning to feel that it is working, although I am not sure what it is trying to do anymore. That always happens with me when a painting takes a while to complete.</p>

<p>Anyway - I am off to Aberdeen next week to catch up with some of my old friends, so blogging might be thin on the ground.</p>
