<p>Well I have yet another very tiring week commuting from London to Oxford, now with the added pressure of looking for a place to live after work. And this without a car or much familiarity with the layout of Oxford. Have pity on me. Saw a couple this week and one might be good, but a bit expensive. The good news is that there is an art studio come up for rent and i am going tomorrow (my day off) to have a look. Maybe I will get a studio before I have anywhere to live. </p>

<p>Came down with the inevitable man cold at the end of last week which meant I had to cancel seeing the <em>Gang of Four</em> with <a href="http://blogs.pumpernickle.net/billy/">Billy</a> on Friday night. Read his <a href="http://blogs.pumpernickle.net/billy/">blog</a> to hear all about it.</p>

<p>Had a nice weekend in Milton Keynes visiting a friend. My first time there and it really is a new town and the MK Dons (formerly Wimbledon Football Club) really do play at the Hockey Stadium. And the town is surprisingly aesthetic in layout and design. Very Pan-europeoan. Still struggling with my cold, so will not go on and on. Getting strong urges to draw, but I need to concentrate my efforts on getting settled. Should get back to Hastings next weekend, where I must update the website a bit, and put up all the last works of 2004 which have only appeared on the blog pages.</p>

<p>If any of my new students are reading this, make sure you get the chance to read up about and have a look at the new show at the <a href="http://www.saatchi-gallery.co.uk/">Saatchi Gallery</a>  <em>The Truimph of Painting</em>. An interesting review in todays <a href="http://observer.guardian.co.uk/review/story/0,6903,1401551,00.html">Observer</a></p>
