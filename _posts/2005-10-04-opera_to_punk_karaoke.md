<p>In between teaching and making art, I had time to squeeze in a couple of mad social engagements this weekend.</p>

<p>On Friday went to see a production of Carmen by <a href="http://www.ellenkent.com/Chisinau_Opera.85.0.html">Chisinau National Opera</a> at the New Theatre Oxford with my friend Lucy. IWhen I was about ten, I was once in a production of Carmen as a little soldier boy who sang a cute song. So, I was looking forward seeing this bit - but they went a cut it out in this production!! Hurumph!! Still once the kid behind me stopped rustling his crisp packet, I really quite enjoyed it.</p>

<p>On Saturday, i went through to London to help <a href="http://blogs.pumpernickle.net/billy/">Billy</a> celebrate his birthday. As we did for my 40th birthday (see <a href="http://mtengine.pumpernickle.net/mt_pages/robbiebushe/previously/2004/12/">Roblog December 6th 2004</a>) we went to the <a href="http://www.punkrockkaraoke.co.uk/">Punk Rock Karaoke</a> at the <a href="http://www.meanfiddler.com/displayPage_garage.asp?PageID=362">Garage</a>. I went along with Dug and Ohna and a bunch of Billy's friends and had a great time. You sing to an actual live band who are fantastic. I sang <em>ever fallen in love (with someone)</em> by the <a href="http://www.buzzcocks.com/">Buzzcocks</a> and thoroughly enjoyed it. Someone took a wee Mpeg movie clip, so I am sure it will find its way on to the blog soon enough.</p>

<p>Did some more paintng on Sunday and Monday and will post the results next time.</p>
