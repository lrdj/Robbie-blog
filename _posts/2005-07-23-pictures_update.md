<p>Finally found a reliable internet cafe here in Limassol in Cyprus. Not much to report these last days. My day is: wake up 6am, cyprus coffee, studio 7am - 12noon, market 12 - 1pm, hammock 1 - 2pm, swim in harbour 2 - 5pm, dinner 8pm, cards and wine till late...</p>

<p>Above are two images of lastest work. The Trodos mountain picure is nearly finished and I am quite pleased with the start I have made to the new one which hold more unconventional space for me. Really geting into my stride now. The third picture is me in the studio this morning. I took it to send to my nephew Harper in Hastings who has just broken his arm, poor fellow.</p>
