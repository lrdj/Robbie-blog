<p>Been a bit a struggle to keep working consistently this last week as we approach the festive season, my 40th birthday and my impending move to Oxford. However I have gritted m teeth and managed to do at least something everday. As you can see from above, I have got a lot of milage out the the fireworks festival I went to in Hastings last month&#8230; casting myself as a giant sacrifice for the fire. Read into that what you may.</p>

<p>I have also finally continued with my large garden painting, which as always hit a crisis of confidence after the initial rush to get it started. I am frustrasted that it has become pedestrian with too many of my signature dotty marks (I never intend to use them but they appear anyway - especially when I run out of ideas). So here is the laatest picture of it - it still has a long way to go&#8230;</p>

<p>I have also just put five small pictures into get framed for the <a href="http://www.scottish-gallery.co.uk/">Scottish Gallery&#8217;s</a> Christmas show. I might even take the work up there myself, funds permitting, so I can visit my brother Chris and then venture up to Aberdeen to see some of my old pals there.. we shall see.</p>
