<p>Not a huge amount different in my life this week than there was last: which means that I am in one of my mindless routines as I work towards completing this series of paintings for the <a href="http://www.wisegal.com">Sarah Wiseman Gallery</a>. They are all trying to use Oxford as a backdrop for thes daft characters to inhabit. There is the giant scotsman as a visitor attraction on Christchurch meadow. And, in another (not detailed above) the same giant scotsman is in disguise as a country gentleman as he must have escaped the park. Maybe <em>King Kong</em> has rubbed off on me more than i imagined. The series of paintings are emerging more surreal than I have done for a while, but hopefully retain some of the spirit of the mundane as I try to convey my own relationship with Oxford over the past year. The colours are very muted and dirty at the moment - which is distinctively different from the Oxford series I did in the Autumn - perhaps because I am using less expensive paint, but also due to the being a very muted and damp time of year here. I have about another 6 weeks to complete them and perhaps do a couple more - but I think I can do that.</p>

<p>The good news is that Catharine put me onto a good framer in Reading who can do it much cheaper than anyone in Oxford. So I have put four of my Cyprus pictures in which are going into the <a href="http://www.affordableartfair.co.uk/location.html">Bristol Affordable Art Fair</a> next month. </p>

<p>This weekend is May Day, and we are going down to Hastings for the <a href="http://www.hastingsjack.co.uk/">Jack in the Green festival</a> (which I painted about two years ago). I cant wait to get my dose of the sea and the madness of Pagan Hastings again.</p>

<p>Till I blog again Robloggers!</p>
