<p>So Easter holidays have come and gone. I have made some steady, if not spectactular progress on the new paintings. I had a vist from Sarah Wiseman and she seemed pleased with the work so far, but there is much to do. I have about 8 weeks left, so I am sure that I will have it all done by then. Sarah also offered to take some of my pictures to the Bristol Affordable Art Fair in May. She selected four of the more major pictures from my 2005 Cyprus work, which I now need to get framed.</p>

<p>So the vacation was a good mix of heading over to Reading to see Catharine and being in the studio. We had one day in London and went to see the Martin Kippenburger at the the Tate. It was an interesting show and I have been meaning to see it for ages.</p>
