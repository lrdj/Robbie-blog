<p>Phew - a mad few days!</p>

<p>I am typing this from my work PC at Brooke, after teaching school kids taster workshops in art foundation. I had driven up from Chichester this morning at 6.30am after a couple days in seeing friends and attending the opening of the <a href="http://www.chichesteropenart.co.uk/">Chichester Open</a>. Bloody exhausted, but might still go down to the studio this evening as I am getting withdrawal symptoms after not painting since tuesday night..</p>

<p>Anyway - I had Thursday and Friday off work so I borrowed a car to go down to Chichester and get back in time to work this morning. I stayed with my old colleague, Vicki Brown and her family in Emsworth, and also visited my old friend Suzie who was in hospital after an operation, (which was a success).  I went to the 'artists preview' of the Open at luchtime after spending a bit of time reaquainting myself with the old place (not much to it really). I had been fantasizing about what I would do with the money if I won the first prize of Â£3500; new iPod, power book etc, etc.. trying not to get too carried away. Anyway - I had thought that that the prizes would be announced at the proper private view in the evening. However, as I arrived at the <a href="http://www.cft.org.uk/">Minerva Theatre</a> (where the Open is held), the judges were already making speeches about 'what a difficult but exhilarating job it was choosing a winner.. the standard this year of the entries was overwhelming...' Anyway, before I could catch my breadth or notice where my works were hung, there was tthe anti-climax of hearing 'the first prize goes to (someone who was not me)' - and I thought - 'shit! I wanted to be dissapointed tonight and not before I have even had my lunch'.. oh well..! Then they called out my name as one the artists whose work was 'highly commended' for the <a href="http://www.asrs94.dsl.pipex.com/2004Hastings3/images/hastingsgarden.jpg" title="Gardens">Battle of Hastings</a>  picture. 'Shit', I thought again! 'I cant buy a new iPod with a highly commended' '. Then I went out for a breather..then rational thought resumed and I became very pleased with the whole thing. Gosh, competitions are just awful really, for what they make you go through. I dont think it is because I am arrogent and thought I might have won - I am just the same whenever I buy a lottery ticket.</p>

<p>Did not know many people at the 'artists preview', so went for a wander and a pint. Found out that Tom (whom I met in Cyprus this year) was in town - so we met up before the main private view for a pint and then he was my 'and guest'  for the night.</p>

<p>Still not many people I knew at the opening. It was quite ironic how many of the types  I had satirised in my  <a href="http://www.asrs94.dsl.pipex.com/2004Hastings2/images/Battle.jpg">Battle for Chichester Cross</a> painting there in attendance. </p>

<p>Near the end of the private view, Nick (who is the administrator of the  Open and a former student of mine from <span class="caps">UCC</span>),sauntered up to me and quietly told me that my Hastings picture had sold (had a good price too).. to Molly from Bognor. Thank you Molly - I am so pleased you like the picture. Images of cool gadgets were once again entering my mind...</p>

<p>A night in the pub, followed by a curry and then a bed in my old flat in North Street (where Andrew now lives, keep up wont you).. then back to reality today.</p>

<p>Now for the framing weeks...</p>
