<p>For good or bad, and with the kind assistance of interface architect and web guru <a href="http://www.donkeyontheedge.com/">Dug</a>, I have added my <a href="http://www.flickr.com">Flickr</a> pictures to this blog. This could be very dangerous, as all I now have to do is take a picture with my camera phone, press a button and bingo, it is on the blog..</p>

<p>I will update for the last ten days later on. Must pack for a wedding in Dorset.</p>
