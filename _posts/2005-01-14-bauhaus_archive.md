<p>Well I am now at the end of my week in Berlin and I must say I am complelely saturated with visits to museums and galleries, walking, U and S Bahning, eating, drinking beer and keeping students enthused!! But Berlin is a great city and I woould like to take some time to write a bit about my week here, but I am too knackered to be honest. Will di it when I get back.</p>

<p>Anyway, below are links to some of the museums I have visited and you can see for yourself for the time being....</p>
