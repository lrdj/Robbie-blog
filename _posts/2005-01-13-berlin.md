<p>Well this is my 5th day in Berlin and I am completely knackered from all the walking. museums and galleries. Too many things to mention as I type this from the Hostel staff computer. (German keyboards are all all over the place, so finding it tough just to type this.) Today we are going to the Neau Nationalgallerie and the Jewsish Museum. My new students seem very nice and are of a very international flavour. Eating too much carbs and sausages!!!</p>
