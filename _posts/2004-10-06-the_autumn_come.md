<p>Well after an extremely productive two weeks, I can at last show you what I have been up to. It seems that the routine of the Autumn and all my travelliing and commuting of late has got me back into a working rythym. And I think that at last I am making some progress. I have been concentrating on creating numerous compostions through drawing, watercolours an even one or two monoprints. You can see some of this work <a href="http://www.asrs94.dsl.pipex.com/2004Hastings3/index.htm">here</a>.</p>

<p>It seems that ater all my walking and commuting, that the one place I had forgotten to look at for source material was here in the house where I am staying in Hastings. A few days ago, as I was waiting for David (my sister&#8217;s partner) to cook the dinner, I decided to do a drawing out of the window from my bedroom. This is the sort of thing I am always tellingstudents to do when they cant think about what to draw.</p>

<p>Not a great drawing by anyone&#8217;s estimation, but it gave me a few ideas of how to develop it. Hastingis is full of of steep terrace gardens going up or down one of the many hills. I had spent a lot of this summer helping build a wooden wall embankment in this garden and had been aware of all the conversations, discussions and (non) neighbourly comments.</p>

<p>I proceeded to make three further studies from this sketch in the studio:</p>

<p>There was something about these images that I thought it could go further, so today I risked starting a large oil painting based on the the essence of these studies. I decided it should be portrait format and and that it should cover up over the hill and a view over to the East Hill and English Channel:</p>

<p><img alt="battleofhastings1sm.jpg" src="http://mtengine.pumpernickle.net/mt_pages/robbiebushe/i/battleofhastings1sm.jpg" width="97" height="120" /></p>

<p><a href="http://mtengine.pumpernickle.net/mt_pages/robbiebushe/i/battleofhastings1.html" onclick="window.open('http://mtengine.pumpernickle.net/mt_pages/robbiebushe/i/battleofhastings1.html','popup','width=405,height=500,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false">View image</a></p>

<p>The above images show the first paint I put down with not much real definition. I was just trying to reflect the muted colours which were in the watercolours. I loved the feeling of the composition already without any description. So, I started to paint in some definition for the composition:</p>
