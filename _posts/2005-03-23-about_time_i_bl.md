<p>I expect you are all wondering why there has been no blog for a while...?! So engrossed in new painting? (not really) Having a great new social life in Oxford? (not yet) Nothing really to say? (more like it). I am typing this as I try to recover from a mystery virus which has wiped me out for the last few days... which has left me with a back back and I can hardly walk...</p>

<p>So what have I been up to since the 6th March? Well work at Brookes has been pretty intense as the students prepared their <span class="caps">UCAS </span>applications and I had to help with their personal statements and write their references... Gosh it is amazing how little grammar is taught in schools nowadays. Except if you are a regular roblogger, you will have noticed how lazy with grammar i have become. The last three weeks have been good in that I have not had to travel anywhere and I have hardly stepped foot out of my work, home, studio triangle. Oh except to see a couple of films... 'Aquatic Life' and 'Team America'. Both worth seeing. Also kept up my swimming at the excellent Rosenblatt pool (until I got ill that is). </p>

<p>But what I have most enjoyed about my new Oxford life is getting out and about on my bicycle, which was always a bit more difficult in Hastings due to the terrible hills. I did spent some of my weekends drawing about and about the town, but have become very rusty and unfocused.. Something did strike me as a potential area for development... Oxford is full of unfulfilled promise. So many of the Oxford University spaces are glimpsed through teasing small doors on much larger ornate wooden gates. Mortals like you and me are not allowed to venture into these seemingly idylic cloistered courtyards. So Ithink there is some visual and human potential for mirth and myth in this idea...</p>

<p>Anyone noticed that I have changed server for my website? If you had specific pages bookmarked you will now be automatically redirected to the homepage. You see I was previously using someone else's web space and now I hae my own again. The address is still the same however (www.robbiebushe.co.uk).</p>

<p>Well, I get a week off next week for Easter. Chance to get stuck into my painting and make the new studio feel more like my second home. Hope I will be feeling better by then...</p>
