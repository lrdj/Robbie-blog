<p>Not able to face up to getting stuck into my big painting at the studio, I spent most of yesterday wandering around hastings (after I had posted my job applications) and trying to draw in my book. </p>

<p>This of course was entirely diversion tactics as I am putting off facing up to the challange of completing my big painting <a href="http://mtengine.pumpernickle.net/mt_pages/robbiebushe/previously/battleunfinisheda.jpg">Battle at Chichester Cross</a>. So, after I had posted my job applications, I went for a long wander around a fairly busy and sunny Hastings. I was actually trying to get people as I have become concerned that the people in my paintings have become far too generic. I need to relook at faces, posture and clothing styles. I actually found this quite difficult as every time I started to draw someone , they would notice and start to scowl at me. Terrifiying! So locations once again became the thing and I would try to quickly capture faces as they passed me by.</p>

<p>I had it in my head to put an ice crem van on the road in my <em>Battle</em> painting. I thought it would add some much needed irony into this pseudo serious subject. So I found an ice cream van at just the right angle viewed from the green by Hastings Castle. "Excellent', I thought once I had done the drawings. </p>

<p>So I went straight down to the studio to paint in the van. Way Hey!! Two hours of puroseful painting passed and then I sat down to ponder at what I had done. It was awful!!! it ditracted so much from the overall scheme and had now become 'ice cream van at chichester cross'. I thought of ways in which I could readjust the tone and colour, but in the end I wiped the van, Then I had another two anxiuos hours  painting while I tried to rescue the whole painting. When you wipe something off, it makes the whole painting look dirty and mirky. </p>

<p>Only when I go down today, will I know how bad or good things got yesterday.</p>
