<p>Just to alert you all that my good friend and wonderful artist, <a href="http://www.barrymcglashan.co.uk/">Barry McGlashan</a> is having his second major show at <a href="http://www.jmlondon.com">John Martin</a> in London this week. The work is based around his recent travels in America and I think that this is some of his best work ever. If you are in London over the next month, then I would highly reccommend going to see it.</p>

<p>I particularly liked this one called 'The Big Eat'...</p>
