<p>Well at last <a href="http://www.catharinedavison.co.uk/">Catie</a> and I are together in Edinburgh. She came back from working at <a href="http://www.geocities.com/artcyprus/">Cyprus College of Art</a> (now in Larnaca) in early September with some wonderful drawings and paintings from her 2 months there, whish you can see on her <a href="http://www.catharinedavison.co.uk">website</a>. Catie was also successfully in gaining a art teaching position at <a href="http://www.lorettoschool.co.uk/">Loretto</a> school in Musselburgh, a stone's throw outside Edinburgh.</p>

<p>So, I went back to work at eca after my short painting break in August, but have managed to continue to paint. I am planning a portrait of  Catie for the BP portrait award and want to set it in our wonderful flat in Leith, along with our collection of 'bears'. So I have embarked upon, what may in the future be referred to as my 'bear period', been painting tiny pictures of the bears as a limbering up exercise. I have quite enjoyed doing them actually. I am also showing some small pictures at the Scottish Gallery this Christmas, so I am hoping that one of these bear pictures will cut the mustard.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, as Catie's Job does not start until after xmas, she has been drawing and painting out and about in Edinburgh (urban gardens) - more wonderful work, which will be on her site soon.</p>

<p>So, it is very nice to have a partner who paints and we are finding each other a great motivator to work.</p>
