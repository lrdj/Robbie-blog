<p>So here I am 5 days into being in Cyprus. I decided to go out as my research bid to go to India fell on deaf ears. I am spending nearly two weeks at Cyprus School of Art in Lemba trying to make some additional works for my show in Chichester in December. I have hired a car and have been drving around and doing small watercolour and gouaches to work from when i get home. So far so good - no major breakthroughs and the work is quite familiar to my other jaunts here.</p>

<p>It is weird being here when the weather is moderate (but still tropical compared with Edinburgh) - the place seems more pedestrian because of it. There are very few students here and two left this week. However it is very nice to get away from work at eca before the onslaught of Summer School.</p>

<p>I will post some of the new pictures soon.</p>
