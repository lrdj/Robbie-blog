<p>I have been a bit lethargic since I got back from Chichester and have not been very productive this week. I am not being too hard on myself as I have been burning the candles at both ends now for over two months. Anyway just a quickie to let you know that my work is now on the <a href="http://www.scottish-gallery.co.uk/home.aspx?category=1">Scottish Gallery's</a> website as part of the 'Human Condition' exhibition which runs from 3 December - 24 December 2005. See and buy the work <a href="http://www.scottish-gallery.co.uk/pages/artistIntro.aspx?artistID=243">here</a>.</p>

<p>Oh - and a quick mention and thank you to <a href="http://blogs.pumpernickle.net/billy/">Billy</a> who has been very active in his support of my work on his blog.</p>
