<p>I was hoping to have new pictures of recent paintings up by now, but over the last few days I have couragously struggled on with the <em>Battle for Chichester Cross</em> painting. It went from bad to worse as it got more a more confused in colour and tone. However, today, and with the help of rather a lot of warm greys (hurray for warm grey), I think I have finally cracked it. It has started to look like I had imagined it at the start. I had quite forgotten how much emotional energy big paintings take out of you. It does now look extremely overworked, but I guess I had to do that to get the measure of what is required, since it is the first big painting I have done in a number of years.</p>

<p>I am off to Rochester off and on for the next week or so. Teaching on the Foundation Art at <a href="http://www.kiad.ac.uk/">Kent Institute of Art and Design</a>. It is only about 45 miles away, but once again I have to take a number of train conections to get there. I am sure all this train hopping will come out somewhere in the art..</p>

<p>So, probably wont be doing much painting over the next week, but I will try to get some images of my recent work up on the site soon.</p>
