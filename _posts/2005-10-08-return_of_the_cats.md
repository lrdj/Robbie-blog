<p>Another extremely busy week teaching, in the studio as well as fitting in an evening of Nick Drake at the <a href="http://www.picturehouses.co.uk/site/cinemas/Oxford/local.htm">Pheonix Cinema</a> with a live band.</p>

<p>I have been plugging away on my small Oxford 'Jungle' paintings which are becoming infested with cats. I am loving that the cats are back in my work. It all sems to make a lot of sense to me. I have never painted such small images with oils which are so detailed. It is like learning a whole new technique. I have only a couple of weeks to finish these so I had a 4am finish last night. Bit tired today.</p>
