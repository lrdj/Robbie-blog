<p>Have not blogged for a week or so. No need to feel guilty. Honest. Its not like I have a following who simply must hear about what I am up to.</p>

<p>Have had a fairly mixed week since I got back from Scotland. Not got back into any real rythym in the studio, mostly due to trying to get stuff framed for <a href="http://www.jmlondon.com/">John Martin</a> at the <a href="http://www.aafnyc.com/">New York Affordable Art Fair</a>. Also, I'm  getting organised for the job interview in Lancaster University this Friday. Can you believe it takes 7 and a half hours and <span class="caps">FOUR </span>changes on the train to get from Hastings to Lancaster. Looking forward to the jaunt however - a chance to sit back and listen to my iPod. (except that my 2nd generation iPod does not play for more than 4 hours without a recharge.... So will have to be choosy about when to listen to music. (Like when the family from hell sit down all around you). </p>

<p>Plugging away at my big 'Chichester' painting - but it is getting bogged down and the original spirit is becoming blurred as I try to formalise it to much. Will have to start another series of pictures soon, so as I can jump from one to the other without too much fear of a ruined day. Will post new images of it soon.</p>

<p>Hopefully I'll get back into my mindless routine next week - swimming, painting, walking, looking for jobs, cooking and helping out with my sister Claire's kids.</p>

<p>We shall see.</p>
