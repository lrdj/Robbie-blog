    commentBody: Good to find another artist blogger.  We seem to be a rare breed, at least in the UK.  I like your drawings.  I think I even recognise one of the places (and, no, I've not been lurking in your kitchen).  Be interesting to see where they might lead.

<p>Well so far this week off has been a good chance to settle down and get thinking about what art I should try and do. I started off playing with Gouache in my little cupboard studio in my flat. But while this was enjoyable, I knew that this would lead nowhere without some subject matter. So I have done a couple of pen drawings from inside my flat - a strange return to Edinburgh domesticity - which is where I started back in 1989. The drawings are very familiar but I am glad to have done them and will continue to do more and see where it takes me..</p>
