<p>It is now near the end of my second week in Cyprus and things are now settling down into a routine. People's personalities have now become clearer to each other in the group, which is both a good thing and a bad thing. There are at least half a dozen really nice people who I am enjoying spending time with immensely and we have developed a late night card school over a few Keo beers. </p>

<p>On Sunday night there was a cafuffle after a girls night out at 3 in the morning and caused a rumpus which kept me awake all night. But actually they did me a favour as Tom suggested we make the best of it a walk doen to the pier and watch the sunrise. It was amazing! And so cliched that no one would ever to attempt to paint it. Except me, after a sleeples night. Here is the result. A Czech girl Lanka has been trying to capture the sunrise in her paintings, so I thought I would give a go too..</p>

<p>Spent the rest of Monday in a hammock trying to catch up on my sleepless night.</p>

<p>Tuesday brought a group bus journey up to the Trodos mountains. This is what I have been waiting for; another look at the distinctive lansdcape within Cyprus. I am now in full flow scribbling in my book, whish is great. I went on a 6K walk over the hills and did three little watercolours in my book.</p>

<p>Anyway, the trip in the mountains gave me a few ideas for pictures and today I started one which I think might be quite fun.</p>

<p>Still a fair way to go and as usual (at least when I am in Cyprus) I am starting at lot of pictures and not quite finishing them. Well it makes my studio look full.</p>

<p><a href="http://mtengine.pumpernickle.net/mt_pages/robbiebushe/previously/DSC00024.html" onclick="window.open('http://mtengine.pumpernickle.net/mt_pages/robbiebushe/previously/DSC00024.html','popup','width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img src="http://mtengine.pumpernickle.net/mt_pages/robbiebushe/previously/DSC00024-thumb.JPG" width="128" height="96" /></a></p>

<p>It has got increasingly hotter as the trip has gone on and until yesterday i was coping with it well. Today it reached 44 degrees and there was no escape except here in the internet cafe.</p>

<p>Looking forward to my trip to Paphos on Saturday, where I will meet Joe, Fiona and their daughter Maisy who are just over from Aberdeen. And I am giving a talk about my work at the Lemba site where I was in 2002. So, I expect my next blog will be on my return after the weekend.</p>
