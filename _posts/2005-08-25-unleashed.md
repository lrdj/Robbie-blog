<p>Staying in Halls this week while I wait to move into new home. Last night I saw <a href="http://www.uip.co.uk/unleashed/">Unleashed</a> at the movies (also known as <em>Danny the Dog</em>). Ludicrous mix of martial arts, london gangster (set in GLasgow!!) and romantic morals. But very enjoyable with that and just what you need when you are staying in an anomymous room. Say no more about it.</p>
