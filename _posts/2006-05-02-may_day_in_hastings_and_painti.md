<p>Now I have got my web server sorted out - just time to do a quick blog. had a great weekend down in Hastings for the Jack in the green where there where hundred of people who looked like this;</p>

<p>Plus at least 5000 bikers! Fabulous.</p>

<p>The rest of the weekend was of course spent in the studio - and I think there is finally light at the end of the tunnel for these two pictures:</p>

<p>I am going to try and concentrate on finishing these two by the end of this week. On friday night I was unable to decide which one to work on so I texted Barry (a roblogaholic) in Aberdeen to ask him which one to work on. He said he thought the one with the trees looks tricky to paint and I should do that one. So it did. But, now I have been avoiding the big one with the pidgeon lady/man (time will tell). Big paintings are such are diferent kind of energy. Maybe tackle it next weekend? Barry? We shall see.. </p>
