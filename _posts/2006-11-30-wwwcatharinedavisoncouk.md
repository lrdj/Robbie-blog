<p><a href="http://www.catharinedavison.co.uk">Catharine</a> has been working on her own site and she has made a really good job of it. She used iWeb, a great Mac application, which helps create very good looking sites. Anyway, her work looks great and she has been busy painting - taking her Cyprus work into some little oil studies. Find her at <a href="http://www.catharinedavison.co.uk">catharinedavison.co.uk</a></p>
