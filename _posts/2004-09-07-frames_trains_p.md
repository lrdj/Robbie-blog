<p>Who would have thought I could get 9 paintings from Hastings to London for a mere Â£17 on the train and taxi. I was so relieved to get them there safely to the John Martin Gallery in one piece. John Martin seemed pleased with the work, but we shall see if they sell at the art fair next month in New York. Pity I wont be able to go over myself to see&#8230;</p>

<p>While I was in the area, I had a look around some of the commercial galleries in the Cork Street area. Three shows caught my fancy: <a href="http://www.chrisgollon.com/index.html">Chris Gollon</a> at the <a href="http://www.arndeangallery.com/">Arndean Gallery</a>, Mauro Perucchetti at <a href="http://www.beauxartslondon.co.uk/">Beaux Arts</a> and <a href="http://www.patrickhughes.co.uk/">Patrick Hughes</a> at <a href="http://www.flowerseast.com/">Flowers</a>. I had not come across Chris Gollon before, but his work is rich, brutal and with deeply loaded images painted in a robust, but ham fisted manner, very suitable for his subject matter. The Mauro Perucchetti was a joy - jelly babies encased in a clear plastic cross and other exquisite objects. Now, Patrick Hughes is one of those artists I love and hate. He is famous for creating 3D optical perspective by painting onto carefully measured and built angles. But, there was one lovely work, <em>With Gusto</em>,  where he had painted all of <a href="http://www.royalacademy.org.uk/?lid=1019">Philip Guston</a>&#8217;s major works in Gallery space, with his trademark optical device. Marvelous.</p>

<p>Didn&#8217;t spend too long in London as I had only a cheap day return and wanted to get back to the studio before the day was out to give it a little tidy and think about the next paintings I will do. I am now quite glad I did not take the Job in Lancaster, as I so want to continue my progess with the painting. Despite being rather poor&#8230;</p>
