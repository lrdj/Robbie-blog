<p>Just a quickie to say that have spent the weekend in London to babysit my nephew Harper. Did manage to fit in a couple of shows:</p>

<p>Glenn Brown at the <a href="http://www.serpentinegallery.org/index.html">The Serpentine</a> and Valie Export at <a href="http://www.camdenartscentre.org/home_noflash.asp">Camden Arts Centre</a>.</p>

<p>If you are in London you must go and see Glenn Brown. Extraordinary paintings, huge and all paintied with exacting precision with a small sable. Brown was a Turner Prize shortlister in 2000 and his work, for me, has given fresh imputus to contemporary painting.</p>

<p>Valie Export at Camden Arts Centre is an odd show. Apparently, she is a pioneer of performance and media art whose practice has exerted a considerable influence on a subsequent generation of artists. I love the Arts Centre and spent a considerable amount of time in the cafe and the bookshop, but not much looking at the work. oh well&#8230;</p>

<p>Bought a copy of <a href="http://www.modernpainters.co.uk/">Modern Painters</a> and went to a noodle bar for lunch.</p>
