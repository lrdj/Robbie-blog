<p>I have been having much trouble with my web server of late. Therefore, I have moved my entire site over to a new one. My address 'www.robbiebushe.co.uk' will still take you to the home page, but all the other pages are now on new pages all beginning with www.robbiebushe.co.uk/. So, if you had certain pages (with asrs94.dsl.pipex.com) bookmarked they will all now take you to my home page. These holding pages will only be active for a short time, to allow people to make the switch. Other than that noting has changed. I will not put the new work up on the galleries pages until it is all complete and in the exhibition in June.</p>
