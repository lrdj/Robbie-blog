<p>Just a quickie to say that this is my second day at Oxford Brookes University. I am commuting from London at the moment using the Oxford Tube coach service from Victoria(for those of you who love to read about my travel arrangements).</p>

<p>There are no students around yet and I have been just getting my head around the course and preparing for next weeks trip to Berlin. It all seems very familiar so far, but i think i will be happier once i get to know the students and have a place and a studio in Oxford... (anyone out there from Oxford??)</p>

<p>Hopefully will find an internet point in Berlin next week to make a fewe blog on the move so to speak. </p>
