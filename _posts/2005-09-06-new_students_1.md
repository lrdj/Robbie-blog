<p>Another quickie to say that the new intake of foundation students are here at Brookes. 60 of them so far and so far it has been us talking at them with all the induction stuff and endless bureaucracy. We take them to London tomorrow and I am also finally moving into a new home as well, fairly near my studio. It will be nice to get all my stuff out of my studio so I can get on with some painting!!! and have a home again for the first time in over a month.</p>
