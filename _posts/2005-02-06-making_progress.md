<p>Just here for my weekly check in to update my progress;</p>

<p>I finally managed to secure a room in a house in Oxford, but I wont be able to move in for another 3 weeks. However, it is close to my job and not far from town so I cant wait. I also nearly have a studio too. I am just waiting to hear back from the people who already work there to see whether they are happy with me moving in. It is a modest space but, again not too far away from work and my digs, and it is a start.</p>

<p>I had some good news this week. I had an invitation to work out in Cyprus for the whole of July. <a href="http://www.geocities.com/artcyprus/">Cyprus College of Art</a> have studios in Limassol where people book to come and make art for a month (usually students). They need someone to look after them while they are there. But I get studio space and lodgings, so I am going. I worked in the Lemba studios in 2002 (see Cyprus 2002 in Galleries), which I loved, so it is great to be going back. And then I am teaching a Narrative Painting Course at <a href="http://www.eca.ac.uk">Edinburgh College of Art</a>  Summer School in August. So, if you fancy being taught by me and make some narrative paintings then book yourself on now. email: continuing.studies@eca.ac.uk or tel. 0044 (0)131 221 6109.</p>
