    commentBody: I kept thinking "is this good or did it just trigger some connection" but I think it has to be the best film I've seen in a while. The idea that the pain never stops and the shit just keeps piling on till you die like we're all stuck on some sort of runaway thing seems very real to me. Now all I need to master is the art of seeing more than one film a year:-)

<p>Just back from seeing <a href="http://www.crashfilm.com">Crash</a>, a movie writtenand directed by Paul Haggis. it is the most mature, grown up and wonderful film I have seen in a good long while and I would thoroughly recommend it. Built ina similar style to Magnolia and perhasp some of Robert Altman's films, it looks at racial tensions and relationships through the intimates eyes of a group of disparate people living in LA and whose lives collide through a series of encounters and real crashes. Take my word for it.. go and see.</p>

<p>It has been tropical in Oxford this week. Very hot and humid; more like one expects in the deep south. Left the cinema to a wonderful thinder storm which has not done much to clear the air.</p>
